# wind-flux

Simply, we use all effective friction velocities derived from the instantaneous estimates of 10 m u-component and v-component hourly wind speeds of the ERA5-Land reanalysis product from 1950 to 2021 to infer sand flux based on the physics formulas of blown sand, and according to the existing studies (Gunn et al., 2021; Chanteloube et al., 2022; Gunn et al., 2022a; Gunn et al., 2022b), further improve the conceptual framework of sand flux, and simply define the flux potential (FP), resultant flux potential (RFP) and azimuthal flux potential (FP_N, FP_NNE, FP_NE, FP_NEE, FP_E, FP_EES, FP_ES, FP_ESS, FP_S, FP_SSW, FP_WS, FP_WWS, FP_W, FP_WWN, FP_NW and FP_NNW). 

Specifically, FP is the sum of FPs to all azimuths; RFP is the resultant flux potential, represents net sand transport potential under the different wind directions; RFD is the resultant flux direction, represents net trend of sand flux; FDV is flux directional variability, defined as the ratio of RFP/FP, represents that the wind comes from the same direction (approximate to 1) or many directions (approximate to 0); FP_azimuth represents the azimuthal flux potential, the sum of azimuthal flux potentials is flux potential (FP); RFP_N or RFP_E represent that FPs to all azimuths are projected to the due-north and due-east directions in order to solve the RFP, RFD and the final FDV. All fluxes are the bulk-volume flux, the units are m2 yr-1.
